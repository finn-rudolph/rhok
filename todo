- count proportion of disjoint paths on large primes by random sampling
- see if the two models for M > 1 hold for truly random mappings (if they do,
  that would be VERY interesting, since it would provide a "counterexample" to
  the random mapping heuristic. if they don't, then hopefully one should be able
  to find literature on that problem)
- derive formula
  - random graphs
  - case distinction disjoint and non-disjoint paths
- look for some monotonicity
- prove the iota binomial distribution
- simplify k = 2 iota distribution proof
