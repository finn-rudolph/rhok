1. using straightforward formulas such as from the birthday paradox, Knuth or the F8-paper, one always finds that k = 1 on every machine is optimal for all M <= 16 (and probably also for greater M).
2. In the conjecture of Pollard and Brent, one level of heuristic assumptions can be removed by proving that the distribution of $\iota$ is binomial.
3. experiments show that when we have $M = 3$, $4 \not \vert \space (p - 1), 6 \not \vert \space (p - 1)$ and ignore the cost of exponentiation, then choosing $K = [1, 2, 3]$ is significantly better than $K = [1, 1, 1]$. Or on the other hand, if one does not ignore the costs of exponentiation, the slowdown is much weaker than predicted by the formulas. (in the experiments, pollard rho was executed on a prime). This contradicts the assumption that the various graphs are independent and random.
